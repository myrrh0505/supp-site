				<h2><strong>understanding what gut disease is</strong></h2>
				<p>Gut disease come in a wide variety of cases, but the one thing that ties all gut disease together is chronic inflammation. Whether it’s GERD, LPR, SIBO, or IBS all these conditions are tied to symptoms caused by inflammation. Some of these conditions caused by physical obstructions or by a malfunctioning nervous system, but both mechanisms creates a cascade of events that lead to damage and long term inflammation. 
					First we must understand what inflammation is. Inflammation is the body’s response to injury as the body increases blood flow, it repairs tissue or fights off foreign pathogens. That is how you must see the root cause of your gut disease, it is simply an injury. And with all injuries, the core concepts in healing in injury comes from sterilizing, rest, and rehabilitation. Just like a festering wound, we must first sterilize and allow it to heal naturally, or a joint injury we must allow it to rest and be rehabilitated.  However the issue is that digestive inflammation is one of the hardest to heal because it is fairy difficult to sterilize, rest, and rehabilitate. Conventional methods of sterilizing often uses antibiotics, however many of these are broad spectrum and wipe out very important native probiotics that are essential to digestion and immunity. Resting the digestive system is nearly impossible because of the need for nutrients, and rehabilitation (dieting) is usually a very strenuous task. However with enough knowledge of each process, healing is achievable. </p>

				<h2><strong>Breaking the cycle</strong></h2>
				<p>The cycle which I speak of is the lifestyle which fuels the root causes of these gut diseases. The two most common causes for these cycles are infection and defects within the nervous system. These conditions are often caused by an imbalance of native bacteria or pathogenic bacteria that lead to infections, or damages to the nervous system which could cause motility issues. Gut diseases often don’t resolve themselves because the infections and defects often become exacerbated by eating. Therefore it is essential to ridding the infection and/or restoring motility. We will go further into depth in how to do so with each condition. </p>
